    <h2 class="heading">We like to think of Lucky Joe’s</h2>
    <p> as a friendly Irish Pub in an Old Western Saloon. 
        Relax and be our guests for a fun and casual dining 
        experience. Starting with the finest, 
        fresh ingredients that we can find, 
        we home-cook them with pride and care for a 
        wonderful lunch, dinner or snack. 
        We feature an extensive list of beers from very near 
        and very far, a thoughtful wine selection and cocktails 
        for kids of all ages. Combined with our Old Town 
        atmosphere and Old-Fashioned hospitality, 
        you can’t help but have a Good Ole Time at Lucky Joe's. </p>
